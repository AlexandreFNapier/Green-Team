# Green-Team
Green team for Software engeneering practical


Our first tasks are as follows;


Documentation

The one content requirement for this week is to create a documentation folder in the shared repository and create a document called setup.md containing instructions 
on how to set up a personal working environment. You need to decide on the best approach for doing this as a team, but the content needs to be checked to make sure 
that the instructions are clear and correct.
